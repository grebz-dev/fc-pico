"""
L4 test for `fcppu_w` (doom/fcbus/fcppu.pio), the receive path that captures one byte per
qualifying Famicom PPU write to $2007. See doom/plan/09-testing-ci.md, section "L4".

Firmware configuration this mirrors (tutorial_project/tuto1_hw/sys/rp_system.cpp,
`rp_system::init()`, SM_RECV): `in`-pins base GPIO6 (unused by pioemu -- see below), `jmp` pin
GPIO17 (CS1), RX FIFO joined, `in` shift right with autopush at 32 bits.

pioemu quirk this test works around: `emulate()` has no `in_base`/`in_count` parameter, so
`in pins, 32` always reads the raw, unshifted 32-bit GPIO0-31 word (see conftest.py's module
docstring for the source-level evidence). On real hardware the captured byte would already sit
in bits 0-7 of the pushed word because `sm_config_set_in_pins(&cw, PI_D0_BIT)` rebases the `in`
group to GPIO6; here it instead sits at bits PI_D0_BIT..PI_D0_BIT+7 (6..13) of the raw word, so
`_byte_of()` below shifts it back down before comparing.
