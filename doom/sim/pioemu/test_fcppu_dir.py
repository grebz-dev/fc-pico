"""
L4 test for `fcppu_dir` (doom/fcbus/fcppu.pio), the bus-direction control program. See
doom/plan/09-testing-ci.md, section "L4".

Not exercised: `fcppu_dir` both waits on and clears a PIO IRQ (`wait 1 irq IRQ_DIR`,
`irq clear IRQ_DIR`) to synchronise with `fcppu_r`. pioemu 0.88 does not decode
`irq set`/`wait`/`clear` at all (see conftest.py's module docstring: hitting one ends
`emulate()`'s generator immediately -- no exception, no further cycles), and even the opcode
that *does* assemble for `wait 1 irq N` is emulated as a plain `wait 1 gpio N`: pioemu's
`WaitInstruction.source` field is decoded but never consulted by the instruction decoder
(verified empirically -- see README.md). So there is no way to drive this program's IRQ
wait/clear handshake correctly in pioemu, only a way to run it and get a misleading answer.
The direction handshake between fcppu_r and fcppu_dir is covered by L5 (full-chip simulation)
and L7 (hardware) instead, per plan/09.

What *is* checked here: the program still assembles cleanly through the same
`.define`/case-quirk preprocessing as the other three programs (see conftest.py), so a future
edit to fcppu.pio that breaks assembly is still caught even though this program's runtime
behaviour can't be emulated.
