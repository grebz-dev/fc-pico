L4 test for `fcppu_rna` (doom/fcbus/fcppu.pio), the read counter that tracks how far through the
frame the PPU has got. See doom/plan/09-testing-ci.md, section "L4".

X is preset to `~null` (0xFFFFFFFF) and `jmp x--` decrements it once per qualifying `/RD`; on
each such read `mov isr, !x` first loads the *pre-decrement* X, inverted, into the ISR. So after
N qualifying reads: `x_register == (0xFFFFFFFF - N) & 0xFFFFFFFF`, and the ISR holds the
complement of X as it stood going into the Nth (most recent) qualifying read's `mov`, i.e.
`(N - 1) & 0xFFFFFFFF` (0 if N == 0, since no `mov isr, ...` has ever run). Both formulas were
checked empirically against pioemu for N in 0..4 while building this test (see README.md).

pioemu quirk this test relies on: `mov isr, !x` does **not** trigger autopush. Autopush only
fires from an `in` instruction's own shift-count bookkeeping reaching `push_threshold`; a plain
`mov` to ISR resets that counter to 0 (pioemu's `write_to_isr()` defaults `count=0`, and only the
`out ISR, n` destination is special-cased to set it -- see conftest.py's docstring and
`pioemu/instruction_decoder.py`'s comment: "no other command where the ISR is written to has a
similar effect"). fcppu_rna has no `push` either, so `receive_fifo` never receives anything from
this program's own execution regardless of the firmware's autopush configuration -- which is by
design: the firmware reads the running count with an explicit, firmware-issued `push noblock`
(`pio_sm_exec(pio0, SM_TRCNT, 0x8000)` in `rp_system::ppu_dma()`), not autopush. This test
therefore reads `state.input_shift_register.contents` directly, standing in for that `push`.
