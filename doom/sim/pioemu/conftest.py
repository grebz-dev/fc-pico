Shared helpers for the L4 PIO program tests (doom/plan/09-testing-ci.md, section "L4 -- PIO
program tests").

Every test in this directory exercises the *real* `doom/fcbus/fcppu.pio` file -- never a copy --
by assembling it with Adafruit's `adafruit_pioasm` (1.3.8) and running the result through
`rp2040-pio-emulator` (`pioemu`, 0.88.0). `load_program()` below is the single place that reads
the file and knows how to work around the two libraries' quirks; see README.md in this directory
for the full narrative and the emulator-API facts this was built from.

Quick index of what was verified empirically (see README.md for the evidence and the exact
probe transcripts) and is relied on throughout this test suite:

  * `adafruit_pioasm.Program(text)` assembles exactly one `.program` block per call ("Multiple
    programs not supported") -- fcppu.pio's four programs must be extracted and assembled one
    at a time. `load_program()` does this by slicing the file on `.program` boundaries.
  * `.define` / `.define public` directives are not implemented by adafruit_pioasm at all (a
    line starting with `.define` falls through to "Unknown instruction: .define"). The symbolic
    pin names are therefore expanded by plain text substitution before assembling.
  * adafruit_pioasm is case-sensitive and only spells its keywords in lower case. fcppu.pio,
    written for the official (case-insensitive) Raspberry Pi `pioasm`, spells the `jmp` "PIN"
    condition and one `IRQ clear` mnemonic in upper case; both are lower-cased here before
    assembling ("jmp PIN 0" -> `ValueError: Invalid jmp condition 'PIN'`; "IRQ clear 7" ->
    `RuntimeError: Unknown instruction: IRQ`).
  * adafruit_pioasm has no "set" modifier for `irq` (only bare/`wait`/`clear`); `irq set N`
    raises `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 0: 'set'`. Dropping the "set" token
    (`irq N`) assembles to the same opcode bits as the default/"set" encoding (mode bits left at
    0), so it is semantically the plain `irq set N` even though adafruit_pioasm cannot parse
    that spelling.
  * `.wrap_target` / `.wrap` *are* implemented by adafruit_pioasm and surface as
    `Program.pio_kwargs["wrap_target"]` / `Program.pio_kwargs["wrap"]`; these map directly onto
    pioemu's `emulate(..., wrap_target=, wrap_top=)` keyword arguments (pioemu's `wrap_top` is
    adafruit's `wrap`).
  * pioemu's `emulate()` has no `in_base`/`in_count` parameter at all: `in pins, N` always reads
    starting at GPIO0 (see `pioemu/instruction_decoder.py`'s `in_sources[0] = read_from_pins`,
    which returns the raw `state.pin_values` word, and `_decode_in`, which never applies an
    offset). `out pins, N` and `out pindirs, N`, by contrast, *do* honour a configurable
    `out_base`/`out_count` (default 0/32) via `emulate()`'s keyword arguments, wired to
    `write_to_pins(out_base, out_count, ...)`.
  * `irq` (set/wait/clear) opcodes are not decoded by either of pioemu's instruction decoders
    (`decoding/instruction_decoder.py` has `# TODO: Add support for MOV, IRQ and SET
    instructions` for the top-level dispatch, and the legacy decoder's IRQ slot is
    `lambda _: None`). Hitting one makes `emulate()`'s generator end immediately with **no
    exception and no further yields** (`emulate()`: `if emulation is None: return`) -- verified
    empirically (see README.md) that a 2-instruction program stopped after an `irq` opcode
    yields zero tuples even when `stop_when` asks for more cycles.
  * `wait <pol> irq N` assembles fine but is emulated as plain `wait <pol> gpio N` -- pioemu's
    `WaitInstruction.source` field is decoded but never consulted by
    `InstructionDecoder._decode_wait()`, which always calls `gpio_high`/`gpio_low` on `index`
    regardless of whether the source was `gpio`, `pin` or `irq`. Verified empirically: driving
    GPIO7 high unstalls a `wait 1 irq 7`.
  * `jmp pin, target` branches (`program_counter := target`) exactly when the configured
    `jmp_pin` GPIO reads high, and falls through otherwise -- verified empirically with a
    3-instruction program where the branch and fall-through targets differ.
  * FIFOs are modelled as plain 4-deep `collections.deque`s (`receive_fifo`/`transmit_fifo` on
    `State`); there is no equivalent of `PIO_FIFO_JOIN_RX`/`TX` (no such keyword exists on
    `emulate()`), so autopush/autopull stall at 4 outstanding words even for a program
    configured to join its FIFOs to 8 on real hardware. Tests in this directory keep the number
    of undrained words comfortably below 4.

# the callable's type hints -- an unannotated parameter is treated as `int` clock with a logged
# warning). Its return value is a 32-bit word; per `emulate()`'s source, only the bits at GPIO
# positions where `pin_directions` is 0 (i.e. configured as inputs) actually take effect --
# direction-1 (output) bits keep whatever the state machine last wrote. Every program in this
# suite runs with `pin_directions == 0` throughout (none of them touch `pindirs`), so the whole
# word returned here lands in `pin_values` verbatim each cycle.
#
# `timeline_source()` turns a plain per-cycle list of 32-bit words into such a callable: cycle
# `state.clock` reads `timeline[state.clock]`, and the timeline's last entry holds for any cycle
# beyond its length (so callers only need to spell out the interesting prefix).
