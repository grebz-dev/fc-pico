L4 test for `fcppu_r` (doom/fcbus/fcppu.pio), the transmit path that presents one byte per
qualifying Famicom PPU read. See doom/plan/09-testing-ci.md, section "L4".

**Coverage note**: `fcppu_r` raises `irq set IRQ_DIR` to hand bus-direction control to
`fcppu_dir` (see test_fcppu_dir.py). pioemu 0.88 does not decode `irq` instructions at all (see
conftest.py's module docstring): hitting one ends `emulate()`'s generator immediately, with no
exception and no further cycles. The single `irq set IRQ_DIR` in this program is therefore
patched to `conftest.NOP_OPCODE` (`mov y, y`, confirmed inert) before emulating, and **this test
does not cover the IRQ handshake to fcppu_dir at all** -- that integration is covered by L5
(full-chip simulation) and L7 (hardware) per plan/09.

**Cold-start note**: `fcppu_r` begins with a one-time `mov osr, null` (contents=0, shift counter
reset to 0) before `.wrap_target`. Autopull only refills the OSR once *its own* out-driven shift
count reaches the 32-bit threshold -- a plain `mov` into the OSR does not itself count toward
that threshold (pioemu's `write_to_osr()` always resets the counter to 0; only the `out ->ISR`
destination is special-cased to set a nonzero counter, per an explicit comment in
`pioemu/instruction_decoder.py` -- see conftest.py). Consequently the first four qualifying
reads after a fresh start shift out that `null`-loaded zero content, byte by byte, before the
first real TX FIFO word is ever pulled in; `test_cold_start_shifts_out_zero_before_first_autopull`
below pins this down explicitly rather than leaving it as a surprise. Real firmware sidesteps it
by manually priming the FIFO/OSR before the PPU's first read of the frame
(`rp_system.cpp`'s `pio_sm_put_blocking()` calls, and the `pio_sm_exec(pio0, SM_TRAN, 0x6008)`
-- "out pins, 8" -- priming in `ppu_dma()`). The other tests below start from an
already-primed OSR (program counter placed at `wrap_target`, i.e. *past* the one-time
`mov osr, null`) to exercise the steady-state byte order in isolation from this transient,
mirroring what the firmware's own priming achieves.
