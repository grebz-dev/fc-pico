"""ppubus.py -- host model of the console side of the fcbus PPU bus (L3).

Models qualifying `$2007` read strobes and NMI-time `$2007` write traffic at
the level of *counts and ordering*, without emulating the 6502 or the PPU's
own video timing -- see ``doom/plan/09-testing-ci.md`` ("L3 -- PPU-bus
model") and ``doom/plan/01-constraints.md`` ("The bus contract").

This model is calibrated against the NES-001 trace in
``tests/fixtures/hw_trace_ntsc/trace_6.hex``. The physical board selects 66
reads on the pre-render line and 64 on every visible line. The transmitter
and counter use the same CS1 and /RD tests, so every selected read both emits
a byte and decrements the counter.

``reads_per_line`` (default 64 = 32 tiles, the picture's visible width)
    Strobes the PIO counter ``fcppu_rna`` attributes to a line. This is
    what ``PPU_COUNT_VAL`` is compared against, so it alone determines
    :meth:`PpuBus.frame_read_count`.
``prerender_reads`` defaults to the measured 66. The NMI issues one dummy
read and ``mailbox_len`` data reads, giving 15,491 physical qualifying reads
for v1. ``fcppu_rna`` publishes ``!X`` before its ``jmp x--`` decrement, so
its value is a zero-based last-read index: 15,490. :meth:`frame_read_count`
models that reported value, while :meth:`frame_qualifying_read_count` and
:meth:`frame_byte_count` model the 15,491 physical strobes.

Buffer layout note: because of this, :meth:`PpuBus.reconstruct` does **not**
assume the same absolute byte offsets as ``fcpico.stream`` (whose
``VRAM_MAILBOX_OFF`` = 15,426 is a real, unambiguous C-pointer offset into
the firmware's buffer). Instead ``reconstruct()`` walks the byte stream using
:meth:`PpuBus.frame_events`'s own structure (pre-render filler,
``reads_per_line`` bytes per visible line, the dummy, the mailbox) and packs
each line's bytes into pixels with ``fcpico.stream.unpack_run`` -- the same
bit-level convention (MSB-first pixel, low byte plane 0 / high byte plane 1)
``convVram()`` and ``fcpico.stream`` use, just not the same byte *offsets*.
:meth:`PpuBus.reference_buffer` builds a buffer in this module's own layout
(the exact inverse of ``reconstruct()``) for tests and for
:class:`SimpleCart`; it is deliberately not byte-identical to
``fcpico.stream.encode_frame()``'s output.
