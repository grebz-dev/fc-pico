 * Host replacements for the pico-sdk alarm/repeating-timer convenience functions that
 * PICO_PLATFORM=host does not provide. See README.md ("what the SDK provides vs what the shim
 * adds") for the full explanation; the short version:
 *
 *   - pico-sdk's src/common/pico_time/include/pico/time.h guards add_alarm_in_us(),
 *     add_alarm_in_ms(), cancel_alarm(), add_repeating_timer_us() and add_repeating_timer_ms()
 *     behind `#if !PICO_TIME_DEFAULT_ALARM_POOL_DISABLED`, and
 *     src/host/hardware_timer/CMakeLists.txt sets PICO_TIME_DEFAULT_ALARM_POOL_DISABLED=1 for
 *     the host platform. So on host these five are not merely unimplemented, they are not even
 *     *declared* -- callers get an implicit-declaration warning (an error under -Werror) and
 *     then an undefined reference at link time. This header re-declares four of them
 *     (add_alarm_in_ms() is a trivial wrapper the caller can write in terms of
 *     add_alarm_in_us(), so it is not reproduced here) with alarm_host.c backing them with a
 *     single background pthread.
 *
 *   - cancel_repeating_timer() is the odd one out: pico/time.h declares it unconditionally and
 *     src/common/pico_time/time.c *defines* it unconditionally too, so it links fine even on
 *     host. But its only functioning path (a match) ends in a call to the alarm-pool timer
 *     adapter's ta_force_irq(), and src/host/pico_time_adapter/time_adapter.c stubs every ta_*
 *     hook to panic_unsupported(). In other words the symbol exists, but successfully
 *     cancelling anything through it panics the process -- worse than a link error, since it
 *     would build fine and only fail at runtime. We cannot fix or shadow it (it is a normal,
 *     non-weak symbol already linked in from pico_time), so repeating timers created through
 *     add_repeating_timer_us()/_ms() below must be cancelled with host_cancel_repeating_timer()
 *     instead -- never with the SDK's cancel_repeating_timer().
