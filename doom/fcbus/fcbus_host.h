 *
 * Simulates both sides of the wire fcbus_core.h talks about, without any PIO or DMA:
 * fcbus_host_ppu_read() stands in for a PPU pattern fetch (what rp_system's DMA/PIO
 * combination would present on the data bus), fcbus_host_ppu_write() stands in for the
 * 6502 writing a byte to `$2007`. Used by doom/tests/fcbus/, and by the higher
 * simulation levels in doom/plan/09-testing-ci.md (L2/L3/L6) that need a cartridge model
 * without device hardware.
 *
 * One global core instance, matching "core 1 owns the one and only rp_system::sys
 * instance" in the original -- a host process only ever needs one bus link.

 * fewer for ARM_NUDGE1, two fewer for ARM_NUDGE2 (see fcbus_core.h), then the front

 * program is actually driving the bus at that moment. Reads taken while the DMA is
 * stopped are counted too -- they return -1 here because no valid data is on the bus, but
